<p>I could not attend to this year’s edition that seemed really great with Eric Evans, Greg Young, Udi Dahan, Ian Cooper and Gojko Adzic.</p>
<p>The videos from the events should be soon somewhere around <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/design-architecture/ddd-exchange-2010/wd-23">here</a>.</p>
<p>And you can already find transcripts of the talks on Gojko ‘I post faster than people talk’s blog :</p>
