<p>I’m just back from DDDx 2011, and it was great !</p>
<p>The event happened Friday 10 at Skills Matter in London, with great speakers, coffee and food.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see all the talks on <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/design-architecture/ddd-exchange-2011/js-2046" target="_blank">Skills Matter website</a>. Congratulation to the team that released the videos on the web in less that an hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was also the occasion to meet IRL DDD practitioners I usually find on twitter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also <a href="http://bit.ly/mse2Ko" target="_blank">register for next year now</a> for only 50£. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Hurry up !</p>
