<p>Some will say it is a sign that lazy load is <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/domaindrivendesign/message/7918">the work of the devil</a>. But I can remember the time when people were saying that garbage collectors are evil.</p>
<p>We all would like to have non intrusive data fetching strategy that work 99% of the time !</p>
<p>The problem is not about lazy load or not. It is that you must take care about your data fetching strategy whenever you make a data access. </p>
<p><em>There is currently no technology smart enough to infer the right fetching strategy.</em></p>
<p>If someone builds it, this won't be a problem anymore.</p>
<p>If you know about it, please tell the world !</p>
