<p>I found through <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DoYouHaveToKnowEnglishToBeAProgrammer.aspx">Scott Hanselman</a>'s blog a conversation starting from</p>

<p><a href="http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2008/10/should-we-use-english.html"><em>"If you don't know English, you're not a programmer."</em></a></p>
</blockquote>  <p>I was 8 when I started playing with BASIC on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-99/4A">TI-99/4A</a> my father bought in the early 80's, and at that time I had never learnt an English word... But that was not a problem as long as the documentation was in my native language.</p>
<p>I had no need to know English since I knew what For, Load, Run, Save did. Ok my pronunciation was a bit sloppy (Load was Lo - a - d, with a big french <em>a</em>) but I knew what the computer would do when I used those commands.</p>
<p>Of course you can achieve a better style and discover libraries ways faster when knowing English, but I don't think it's a requirement. It's better though to use a widely spread language when you want to share your code. I've had already hard time reading Italian code, but this is more a problem about languages in general than a problem about programming.</p>
<p>Don't be stopped by your native language, programming languages are languages per&nbsp; se, and you should <strong>learn a new [programming] language every year</strong>. Why not English ?</p>
