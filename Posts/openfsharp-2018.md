I had the chance this year to be speaking at [OpenFSharp](https://www.openfsharp.org/) conference in San Francisco !

It's once again the occasion to meet the F# community, people I know and new people I don't :)

I took time to put online the code from the workshop and my two talks:

* [Functional Event Sourcing](https://github.com/thinkbeforecoding/UnoCore/tree/solution)
* [Ukulele tabs](https://github.com/thinkbeforecoding/fsuke)
* [Applicatives IRL](https://github.com/thinkbeforecoding/applicatives)

Thank you all for the feedback and advice.

And special thanks to [Mathias](https://twitter.com/@brandewinder) and the team for the organisation !
