You can find a summary of the talk in French <a href="http://thecodersbreakfast.net/index.php?post/2009/06/16/Paris-JUG-%22Domain-driven-design%22-%3A-compte-rendu" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>  <h1>Putting the model to work</h1>  <p>It was the title of the talk. I’ll not make a full report since it was mainly what’s in the book for those who had not grasped the concepts of DDD yet.</p>  <p>I’ll talk about important topics of the content in following posts.</p>  <h1>Diner with Eric Evans and Jug guys</h1>  <p>After the presentation, we moved to a restaurant with Eric Evans, the organizers and other attendees. I had the chance to be at the same table as Eric, so I had the opportunity to talk with him about a lot of things. </p>  <p>He’s not at all the Pattern Guru kind. Very careful to let you understand he’s not found a solution to your problems, that you’ll have to work, but that his experience and analysis can help to grasp things a bit more clearly. He’s constantly working hard on several project to get more experience and set his knowledge and experimentation against different contexts.</p>  <p>I’ll also talk about part of our discussion in following posts.</p>
