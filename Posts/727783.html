<p>Last week I made a big 3 hour presentation (oops I forgot the pause..) at the DevoxxFr conference.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>It was the second edition of this big Java oriented event in Paris, and a big success: 1400 attendees, 180 speakers for 160 presentations.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>I’ve seen a lot of interesting talks there and met nice people ! I can sincerely recommend it to anyone, even not fluent in Java.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>I posted <a href="http://fr.slideshare.net/jeremiechassaing/le-temps-cest-de-largent" target="_blank">the slides of my talk on SlideShare</a> – french only.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>I’ll post a link the the recorded video as soon as it’s available.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>The slides don’t contain the details of the F# live coding of a Uno game, but it was quite similar to my <a href="https://github.com/thinkbeforecoding/m-r" target="_blank">SimpleCQRS F# implementation</a> on GitHub.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Someone noticed it was a F# presentation in a JVM conference while there was no F# at the last TechEd…</p>
