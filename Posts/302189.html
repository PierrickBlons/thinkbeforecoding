<p>It's quite strange how ideas can appear at the same time in different places. This morning while take a shower I was thinking about a future post series about programming and building architecture and how things had changed in the last few years. Only 1h later I was reading <a href="http://www.codethinked.com/post/2008/11/23/Dont-Be-Afraid-of-Easy.aspx">this post</a> by <a href="http://www.codethinked.com/">Justin Etheredge</a>, that matches exactly this subject.</p>
<p>I'm still preparing the posts however.</p>
