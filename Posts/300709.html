<p>But what does the <strong>Save</strong> button really mean ?</p>
<p>Back in the floppy days, there was no fast persistent storage. To work at acceptable speed, you had to manage everything in memory, the take a few seconds to save at some point. At that time, most of the storage mediums were removable.</p>
<p>Today, things are different. You can't find a computer without a hard disk or solid state drive.</p>
<p>When an application proposes a save action you should understand :</p>
<ul>
<li>My application stores my data in memory </li>
<li><em>If I forget to save it, my data will be lost !</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>As Chase Saunders states&nbsp; in <a href="http://community.irritatedvowel.com/blogs/pete_browns_blog/archive/2008/11/18/When-Will-the-Floppy-Disk-Die-as-a-Save-Icon_3F00_.aspx#3053" target="_blank">his comment</a> this is what he calls a 'Make It Work' button !</p>
<p>Is this a feature ? It's a curse !</p>
<p>How would work a program without <strong>Save</strong> button ?</p>
<ul>
<li>The document would be persisted continuously on disk. </li>
<li>It would have a default name (the first sentence ?) in a default location. </li>
<li>The program would display a list of available documents. </li>
<li>You should be able to <strong>Copy</strong> (instead of Save As) your document to another place. </li>
<li>You should be able to <strong>Delete</strong> it from its location. </li>
<li>For complex documents the program would propose versioning or labeling to mark important documents steps. </li>
</ul>
<p>The world would then be a better place !</p>
